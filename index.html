            <h4 id="what_is_cybersecurity">What is Cybersecurity?</h4>
            <p>In layman's terms, cybersecurity is the field that helps businesses and organizations defend devices, machines, and services from electronic attacks by nefarious actors such as hackers. While there can be offensive components to cybersecurity, most of today's professionals focus on determining the best way to defend everything from computers and smartphones to networks and databases from attackers. </p>

               <p> Using illustrations, Cyber security is like a bodyguard against crimes and offensive entities that can be harmful to a body or an organization. Cybersecurity is the protection to defend internet-connected devices and services from malicious attacks by hackers, spammers, and cybercriminals. The practice is used by companies to protect against phishing schemes, ransomware attacks, identity theft, data breaches, and financial losses.
                Look around today's world, and you'll see that daily life is more dependent on technology than ever before. The benefits of this trend range from near-instant access to information on the Internet to the modern conveniences provided by smart home automation technology and concepts like the Internet of Things.</p>
               <p> With so much good coming from technology, it can be hard to believe that potential threats lurk behind every device and platform. Yet, despite society's rosy perception of modern advances, cyber security threats presented by modern tech are a real danger.
                Most of today's professionals focus more on determining the best way to defend all assets, from computers and smartphones to networks and databases, from attacks. As there are new developments, more challenges are faced, hence, the means to tackle these cyber challenges is where CYBER SECURITY comes in. However, a guard won't be needed if there is no trouble or fear of one.

                What is cybercrime
            </h4>
            <p>Cyber crime, simply put, is the need for cyber security. Cyber crime can also be regarded as any unsanctioned program held as regards to a computer, device or network. Cyber crime is a means of accessing information that are not meant to be accessed, these actions, hereby, requires the need for cyber security professionals and experts who can avert these problems. Cybercrime could be in three generally recognized means: computer-assisted crimes, crimes where the computer itself is a target, and crimes where the computer is incidental to the crime rather than directly related. Now let us dive into some cybercrimes, you would most definitely recognize a few in the following reads.
                </p><p>Cybercrime can take just any form in the tech world. In fact, you might have gone against the normal trend of how a device, network or a computer should normally work or operates, you know what that makes you? Let us forge ahead. </p>
                <p>Now, one of the very common forms of cybercrime is PHISHING. Now just in case someone walks up to you to ask you what phishing is, you can easily tell them that phishing, is a means of impersonating or copying trusted entities or organizations, hence, creating fake social media profiles and websites, hereby carrying out activities that are quite contrary to the actual purpose of the original organizations-which could prove harmful afterwards. </p>
                <p>Phishing scams are one of the very common crimes in the tech world. Take for example, a person can send an email in the name of a particular company, pretending to be one of the employees in that company, hereby, uses that medium to exploit the end party. Let us take another example, this one is mostly common. A person can just pick up his phone to access his whatsapp contents for the day and meets himself in a group he was not aware about in the first place, a wary person should not be free with such incidents but should be wary as a wary individual should be. In this whatsapp group, ridiculous means could be used to fetch out money from participants in the group, hence the sad part, is people falling for these crimes. </p>
                <p>Another cybercrime that can be generally recognized is the “Internet fraud”. This type of scam is the most popular cybercrime flying around. Scams such as “Send #50,000, get #500,000”. The most famous one is the “Nigerian” scam, also known as the “419” scam which is the number of the Nigerian Law it violates.</p>
               <p> These scams are already widespread through fax, telephone and emails, however, the internet now catapults these scams into the limelight and has given these perpetrators easy means to go through with these troubling schemes.

            <h4 id="Benefits-Of-Cybersecurity">Benefits Of Cybersecurity</h4>
            <p>Cyber security is typically important in the tech world because it helps to preserve and manage important businesses in the tech world without facing challenges that cannot be dealt with. 
                Without Cyber security, lots of websites will not really give users access to their websites because if they do so, they will be scared of many other issues that can take place if they do, and perhaps they are not capable to face these issues, they avoid them by giving just a few people access, this is typically bad for growth too.</p><p> Imagine you have an assignment that needs to be hurriedly dealt with but you can barely find any access to the websites that can provide you answers because most of them have already placed ridiculously high amounts on their websites in order to gain access. </p>
               <p> However, with cyber security, these situations can be avoided.

            <p>Cybersecurity is generally known as CIA TRIAD or CYBER. C here stands for <strong>Confidentiality(to secure privacy)</strong>, I here stands for <strong>Integrity(authority of data)</strong> and A here stands for <strong>Availability(without this, there is no confidentiality or integrity. For C and I are to be activated, A is required.)</strong></p>
            <p>The thumb rule of CIA TRIAD is to <strong>Protect</strong>(confidentiality), <strong>Preserve</strong>(integrity) and <strong>Promote</strong>(Availability)</p>
